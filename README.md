## Dove - Airline Reservation System

**Abstract**

The main purpose of this implementing Airline Reservation System software is to reduce the manual errors involved in the airline reservation process and make it convenient for the customers to book the flights as when they require. This software provides options for viewing different flights available with different timings for a particular date and provides customers with the facility to book tickets conveniently. Modification and cancellation of reservations can only be done by the Admin. The design of software is very simple and user-friendly. It is implemented in Java, since it is easy to program in, it precludes the need to deal with low-level memory management and includes powerful libraries for database management and JavaFX.

**Methodology**

JavaFX enables us to design with Model-View-Controller (MVC), through the use of FXML and Java. The "Model" consists of application-specific domain objects, the "View" consists of FXML, and the "Controller" is Java code that defines the GUI's behavior for interacting with the user. Another best practice worth remembering is to style your GUI components with CSS. Doing so is a modern approach that enables you to change the application's look and feel by simply switching the style sheet that is currently in use. The second approach of styling the GUI is used in the present project. This included creating a separate .css file and linking it to the project.

**Software Requirements**

1. JavaFX Application: JavaFX is a Java library used to build Rich Internet Applications. The applications written using this library can run consistently across multiple platforms. The applications developed using JavaFX can run on various devices such as Desktop Computers, Mobile Phones, TVs, Tablets, etc. To develop GUI Applications using Java programming language, the programmers rely on libraries such as Advanced Windowing Toolkit and Swing. After the advent of JavaFX, these Java programmers can now develop GUI applications effectively with rich content. 
2. JDK Version 2 or above: The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development. 
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Netbeans IDE or IntelliJ IDE(Recommended) or Eclipse IDE.
 4. Operating System: Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 or Ubuntu 18.04.
 5. Database: MySQL Database.

**Conclusion**
Implementing an employee desktop front end with native technology is a valid approach and that JavaFX is a good fit. • JavaFX is available on the leading desktop operating systems (Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X). • It is being used by an increasing number of Java developers. Regardless of its future, it will benefit from a strong developer community. • It provides a clear and clean architecture and features many enhancements: styling, event management, transitions, scene graph—to name a few. •It provides the possibility of developing up-to-date user interfaces with animations, multitouch, and the like. • It is based on a clear and clean language: Java. • It provides all the professional Java tools required to debug, analyze, profile, and logs a client application. • It enables a simple app-like installation on the client side, without any prerequisites. JavaFX is a good native UI environment that provides all these features today.
